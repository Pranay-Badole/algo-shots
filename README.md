# AlgoShots

* This contains solutions to problems from [AlgoShots](http://algoshots.herokuapp.com/practicepage/).
* I would recommend AlgoShots to one who is a beginner in CP.
* It contains 25-50 hand-picked questions of each rating from 800-2000 with a detailed and interactive explanation.
* You can connect your codeforces handle to check which questions you have already solved.
* You will know the standard algorithm and cool techniques used for a specific problem as there is explanation and code there itself, but see the tutorial only when you are stuck for quite a long time and unable to get any further leads.
